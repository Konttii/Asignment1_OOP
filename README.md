This project represents a simplified Freelance Job Portal developed using object-oriented programming principles in Java. The project continues the previously selected subject area and focuses on applying core OOP concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system includes the main entities JobListing, which represents freelance job postings, Freelancer, which describes registered freelancers, and Portal, which serves as the central class for managing and organizing data within the application. All data in the project is encapsulated, with class fields declared as private and accessed through public getter and setter methods, following the principle of data hiding. The application organizes a data pool using collections and supports searching, filtering, and sorting of freelancers and job listings based on different criteria such as skills, names, and budgets. Inheritance is used to share common attributes and behaviors between related classes, while polymorphism is demonstrated through method overriding and usage of parent class references. The toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods are overridden in domain classes to ensure readable object representation, correct object comparison, and proper behavior in collections. The project fulfills all assignment requirements and is prepared for submission via a GitHub repository link and further project defense.
